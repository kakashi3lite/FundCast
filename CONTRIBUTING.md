## üìã Development Guidelines

### Code Standards

**Python Code:**
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- Use type hints for all functions and methods
- Write docstrings for all public functions (Google style)
- Maintain 95%+ test coverage
- Use async/await for I/O operations

**Security Requirements:**
- Never commit secrets or sensitive data
- Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
- Validate all user inputs
- Follow OWASP security best practices
- Add security tests for new endpoints

**Testing:**
- Write unit tests for all new functionality
- Include integration tests for API endpoints
- Add security tests for authentication/authorization
- Use pytest fixtures for test setup
- Mock external dependencies

### Code Style Enforcement

We use automated tools to maintain code quality:

```bash
# Format code
black src/ tests/
isort src/ tests/

# Lint code
ruff src/ tests/
flake8 src/ tests/

# Type checking
mypy src/

# Security scanning
bandit -r src/

# Run all checks
make lint
```

### Commit Guidelines

We follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) for consistent commit messages:

```
type(scope): description

feat(auth): add multi-factor authentication support
fix(api): resolve rate limiting edge case
docs(readme): update installation instructions
refactor(database): optimize query performance
test(compliance): add Reg CF workflow tests
chore(deps): update security dependencies
```

**Types:**
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `perf`: Performance improvements
- `test`: Adding or modifying tests

## üîí Security Considerations

### Security-First Development
- **Threat Modeling**: Consider security implications of all changes
- **Input Validation**: Validate and sanitize all user inputs
- **Authentication**: Ensure proper authentication for all endpoints
- **Authorization**: Implement fine-grained access controls
- **Encryption**: Use encryption for sensitive data
- **Audit Logging**: Log security-relevant events

### Security Testing
```bash
# Run security tests
make security-test

# Dependency vulnerability check
safety check

# SAST scanning
bandit -r src/

# Container security (if applicable)
docker scout cves
```
